# Prediction Model for Quantification of Exercise Activity : Prediction Assignment Writeup
Repository for Practice Machine Learning Course work

This Repository consists files related to project *Prediction Mode for Quantification of Exercise Activity* as a part of the CoursEra listing under *Practice Machine Learning*. 

## Project Background:

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively, these devices are a part of quantified self-movement which consists of group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health. Usually people tend to quantify how much of an activity they do instead of quantifying how well or good they perform the activity.

## Project Goal:
In this project the goal is to use the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
